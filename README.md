# predi-home

## Project Abstract

An Cloud AI-driven embedded system that learns the time-series state of a smart home to predict and automate sequences of states and actions via neural net training on human-computer/appliance interactions. To design and prototype the system, I utilize HomeIO to simulate and genenrate data of the trajectories of smart home residents, ConnectIO to control the smart home and process the data on an STM Nucleo, and Amazon Web Services to train an adaptive neural network that learns time-domain functions for all the appliances/computers in the smart home.
